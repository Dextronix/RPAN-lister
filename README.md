What is RPAN lister?  
>A javascript based application that uses the reddit stream API to get the latest running streams and display them. 

Why?  
>It started with a strong dislike of the system in place. I do not like the "previous" and "next" aspect of RPAN, though I love the concept of Reddit streaming. Furthermore, I want all of the information about current streams in one place and that's exactly what this tool does.  

What can it do?  
>- **Sorting:** you can sort streams by various criteria *(such as viewers, upvotes, username, and subreddit among others*). Done by double-clicking the top tabs.

>- **Hide users & subs:** if for whatever reason you no longer want to see streams by a particular user, you can hide them, the same thing for entire subreddits too! Done by left-clicking (or holding if on mobile) over the subreddit or username.

>- **Highlight Users:** If you like a certain user enough to have their streams marked by a bright color then this is for you. Done by accessing the same user menu mentioned above.

>- **Auto refresh mode:** In the settings menu there is an option to set an auto-refresh timer for a given number of seconds (between 5 and 60). If you want to refresh manually you can by either clicking the refresh button at the bottom of the page or pressing the escape key. 

>- **Dark mode:** If you prefer a darker UI than the retina-searing white of the default. This mode is for you. Black and gray make the eye strain go away. 

>- **Color Customization:** If you want the interface to be varying shades of olive green, you can do that in the settings menu under the "Color Settings" tab by clicking a color and using the picker menu. 

>- **More?:** This application is still in active development and may gain more features in the future (but also may not). I am not a professional programmer by any definition of the word but, you can still view all of the code right here in this repo.
Mobile Support?
>Currently I can only test on Android and emulated iPhone. So I don't have any way to guarantee a great experience on mobile. 

Issues / Contact:
>If you want to contact me you can through either the Reddit messaging system or by email: Github6@gmx.com, though I check that much less often than I do Reddit.
